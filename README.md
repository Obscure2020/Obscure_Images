# Obscure Images

I created this repo in November of 2023, shortly after recieving word that Discord would begin limiting the lifetime of its CDN links to 24 hours.

This repo exists for no other purpose than to contain files which I wish to make publicly accessible online, with stable links to their raw forms.

Leaving a note here, for my own future reference:
